# Checks

**CLOMonitor** runs sets of checks periodically on all the repositories registered in the database. These checks are run *every hour*, provided the repository has changed since the last time it was checked. In the case of repositories that don't change often, we make sure that they are checked at least *once a day* anyway. This way we keep reports up to date with the latest checks additions and improvements.

Checks are organized in `check sets`. Each `check set` defines a number of checks that will be run on the repository and one or more `check sets` can be applied to a single repository. At the moment the following sets are supported: `code`, `code-lite`, `community` and `docs`. The set of checks run for each one are as follows:

- **code** (recommended for projects' primary code repository)

  - Documentation / Changelog
  - Documentation / Contributing
  - Documentation / Maintainers
  - Documentation / Readme
  - License
  - License / Approved
  - License / Scanning

  - License / Approved

Many checks rely on checking that certain files exists on a given path. Even though most of these checks support a number of variants, sometimes this won't work for some projects that may be using a different repository layout. In those cases, the recommended approach is to add a section to the `README` file of the repository pointing users to the document location. This will help users discovering this information and will make CLOMonitor happy :) At the moment we support detecting headers as well as links in `README` files that follow some patterns. Please see the reference below for more information on each case. Some projects have already proceeded this way successfully: [Kubernetes clomonitor PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108110), [KEDA clomonitor PR](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/pull/2704) and [Cilium clomonitor PR](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/19037).

For more details about how each of the checks are performed, please see the reference below. If you find that any of the checks isn't working as expected or you have ideas about how to improve them please [file an issue](https://github.com/cncf/clomonitor/issues) or [open a discussion](https://github.com/cncf/clomonitor/discussions) in Github.

## Exemptions

Sometimes some of the checks may not be applicable to a repository (i.e. Artifact Hub badge in the Kubernetes project). In those cases, it's possible to declare an exemption in the [.clomonitor.yml](https://github.com/cncf/clomonitor/blob/main/docs/metadata/.clomonitor.yml) metadata file.

Each of the exemptions declared must include a reason that justifies it. Exempt checks will be specially marked in the UI, and the provided justification will be displayed to let users know why the check was not required in this case.

The checks identifiers (**ID**) required to declare an exemption can be found in the reference below.
