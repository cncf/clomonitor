  description: A map that gives customers and stakeholders public information about
    grid capacity and grid connection cost in different locations. The purpose is
    to give early indication to customers that want to connect to the grid. The aim
    is to ensure customer and stakeholders expectations on grid connections are realistic
    to give a better connection experience with fewer surprises for both grid owner
    (DSO/TSO), grid customers and other stakeholders.
