# Welcome

Welcome to the [CLOMonitor](/) documentation. CLOMonitor is a tool that periodically checks open source projects repositories to verify they meet certain project health best practices.

The documentation is organized in the following topics:

| Topic                                                    | Description                                                                                                                                             |
